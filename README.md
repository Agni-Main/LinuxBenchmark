# LinuxBenchmark
A repository for creating a benchmark suite which works in Linux 


There are a pleothera of benchmarking tools available for windows and mac os. However, I think Linux doesnot get quite the same treatment.
Here, in this repository I try to create a GUI based benchmarking suite that runs flawlessly on Debian based systems. 
This program will mostly be written in c++.
I hope my projects will help serve the community.
